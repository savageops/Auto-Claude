"""
Follow-up PR Reviewer
=====================

Focused review of changes since last review:
- Only analyzes new commits
- Checks if previous findings are resolved
- Reviews new comments from contributors and AI bots
- Determines if PR is ready to merge

Supports both:
- Heuristic-based review (fast, no AI cost)
- AI-powered review (thorough, uses Claude)
